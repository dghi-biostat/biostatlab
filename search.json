      "contents": "\r\nLab 0\r\nTask 1:\r\nOpen RStudio. Click File > New Project. Hit “Existing Directory” and then “Browse”. By now, you should have created a folder for this course’s lab, and a subsequent folder within for Lab 0. Open the Lab 0 folder and hit “Open”. Then hit “Create Project”.\r\nTask 2:\r\nNext, open a new R Markdown file.\r\nTask 3:\r\nNote that for this step, you should first install three packages using the following codes; If you have already installed these packages once before, proceed to 3.b. directly.\r\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\") install.packages(\"skimr\")\r\nLoad libraries:\r\nIn a fresh code chunk, call in the {tidyverse} and {skimr} packages using the following codes:\r\nlibrary(tidyverse) library(skimr)\r\nTask 4: Load data\r\nYou will use the dataset kenya_dhs_dataset_lab_0.rds for this lab. Save the kenya_dhs_dataset_lab_0.rds dataset from SAKAI into the same folder as your New Project. Use command readRDS(‘filename.rds’) to load in the dataset. Don’t forget to use the assignment operator to give the dataset a name after importing the data. As an example, you can name it like this:\r\nkenya <- file name\r\nTask 5: Explore the dataframe\r\nFamiliarize yourself with the data by using the commands head(), length(), skim(), and nrow().\r\nAre there any string/character variables?\r\nAre there any variable or value labels?\r\nDo any variables have notes?\r\nTask 6: Create variable mage\r\nCreate a variable mage for mother’s age (as an integer) at the time of each child’s birth (note – some of these mothers have had multiple children) using the mutate() function. This is calculated from variables b3 (month code of child’s birth) and v011 (month code of mother’s birth). The difference between the values of these variables is months, so divide by 12 to get years. See the data dictionary for a more detailed description of month codes and how to use them. Use the as.integer() function within your mutate() function to truncate the calculated value to an integer.\r\nREMINDER: For your mutate function to work, you have to merge the changes into your dataset. As an example, use this before the mutate function: kenya <- kenya %>%\r\nTask 7: Frequency distributions of mage\r\nSuppose you want to break down mage into three categories. First, look at the frequency distribution (one-way frequency table) for mage to see where you might draw lines for your categories using the table() command.\r\nAre there any missing values for age? If so, how many?\r\nWhich range of ages appear the most frequently in mage?\r\nTask 8: Create variable magec\r\nUsing mage, generate a new variable with three categories: <18, 18-39, and ≥ 40, naming the new variable “magec” (mother’s age categorical). Set the values for magec to be 0,1,2, where 0 corresponds to the youngest age group (<18). Recommended steps:\r\nFirst, don’t forget to use the assignment operator to save your changes to the kenya dataframe.\r\nThen, use mutate() to create a new variable, magec,\r\nwithin your mutate() command, use case_when() to create a series of conditional statements that assigns number 0, 1, and 2 to each category\r\non a new line of code, use factor() to assign labels to each level of your new variable\r\nVariable Label: “Age in years categorized”\r\nValues:\r\n0: <18\r\n1: 18-39\r\n2: ≥ 40\r\nTask 9: Cross-tab of mage and magec\r\nLook at a cross-tabulation (two-way table) of mage and magec to ensure that magec was created correctly. Be sure missing values were handled properly (all observations that have a missing value for mage should be assigned the R missing value “NA” for magec.). Type “?table” for help with how to create a 2x2 table. Note: the order of the variables in the command controls which one is in the rows and which is in the columns of the table. Experiment to make your table readable.\r\nTask 10: Save new dataset\r\nSave the new dataset in the same directory using a different file name with the form shown in the instructions on page 1 using the saveRDS() command.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

You will also need packages {skimr} and {tidyverse}\r\nTo run a line of code, use the shortcut ctrl + enter (Windows)/cmd + enter (Mac)\r\nTask 2: Recode variables\r\nConstruct the following derived variables using a pipe and mutate(). For each, examine the component variables for coded special values (e.g., missing, unknown) and be sure to set derived variable values appropriately. Label all variables and the coded values for the categorical ones using the factor() command.\r\nTask2a: bord5\r\nbord5: Dichotomous variable indicating birth order of the child. [0=current child was 1st through 4th in the birth order, 1=current child was later than 4th in the birth order]. Based on variable bord (birth order).\r\nTask 2b: male\r\nmale: Dichotomous categorical variable indicating that the child is male [0=female, 1=male]. Based on variable b4.\r\nTask 2c: mweight\r\nmweight: Continuous variable for maternal weight at time of interview (in kilograms). Based on variable v437. Note that v437 contains 1 implied decimal place. Divide by 10 to get kilograms.\r\nTask 2d: mheight\r\nmheight: Continuous maternal height at time of interview (in meters). Based on variable v438. Note that this variable is in centimeters and also contains 1 implied decimal place.\r\nTask 2e: mbmi\r\nmbmi: maternal body mass index (BMI). Weight (kilograms) / height2 (meters).\r\nTask 3: Frequency histograms\r\nGenerate frequency histograms of mweight, mheight and mbmi.

Calculate percentages only for the non-missing values. Round percentages to 1 decimal place.\r\nTask 5a: bord5\r\nTask 5b: magec\r\nTask 5c: male\r\nTask 6: Table 2\r\nTable 2 is the data dictionary for the Kenya dataset, with columns added to annotate the variables and provide summary statistics.\r\nFill in these columns in this table for the variables originally on the dataset.\r\nAdd rows for the 7 new variables that you have created in both Labs 0 and 1.\r\nTask 7: Short answer\r\nExamine the range and proportion of missing values for each of the 7 variables you have created in Labs 0 and 1. Are there characteristics of any of these variables that are concerning (e.g., missing, suspicious or impossible values)? In contemplating analysis of these data, what do you think should be done with anomalous information? What effect would missing values have on the validity of your analyses (e.g., how might missing or extreme values affect inferences)? (Response no longer than 250 words, please)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
