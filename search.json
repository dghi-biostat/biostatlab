You will be able to:\r\nStart a new project and import data\r\nUnderstand useful R terminology\r\nUse summary statistics to describe the Kenya dataset\r\nCreate a categorical variable using a continuous one\r\nGenerate histograms and boxplots using ggplot2\r\nCreate a simple cross-tabulation of two variables\r\nTask 1: Establish a workflow\r\nIn R, we organize our work by projects. It is best practice to keep no more than one project in any single folder on your computer. First, we should establish the file folders from which we’ll be working.\r\nCreate folders to store your work\r\nIf you haven’t already, now would be a good time to:\r\nCreate a new folder on your computer called “705 Lab”.\r\nWithin that folder, create a folder for this lab, called “Lab 0”.\r\nFinally, within that folder, create a folder for your data, called “data”\r\nSave the dataset titled Lab_0_kenya.rds (from Sakai) into the folder called “data”\r\nPlease make this a habit. We will expect you to do this for every lab, as it will keep your work organized and will keep you happy.\r\nCreate a New Project in RStudio\r\nNow open RStudio and take a deep breath. Don’t panic. This will all be very familiar in a few short months from now.\r\nInitiate a new project by going to File and clicking New Project.\r\nTODO: INSERT SCREENSHOT\r\nThen select Existing Directory and hit Browse. Navigate to the folder titled Lab 0. Open it, then hit Open.\r\nTask 2: Familiarize yourself with R Markdown\r\nNow, you will open a special kind of document known as “R Markdown”. This is a text editor (like Word or Google Docs), but with a twist. You can run code within the document. This makes data analysis an interactive, iterative (and therefore fun?) process that usually goes:\r\nWrite some code intended to transform your data\r\nRun the code\r\nObserve how your dataset behaved\r\n(Optional) Take a few notes\r\nTweak code\r\nRepeat\r\nFor each lab, we will provide you with a skeleton Markdown file on Sakai. If you haven’t already, download that file (“lab0_705_fall2021.Rmd”) and save it to your folder called “Lab 0”.\r\nNow open the file in RStudio. You can just double-click on it from the file folder. It will appear, but might feel a little pinched. Luckily, RStudio allows Markdowns to pop-out.\r\nClick the white square at the top of the file that I’ve circled in the photo below to do just that:\r\nPop-outTask 3: Load packages and data\r\nInstalling packages\r\nPackages are collections of functions. As we’ll see shortly, we use functions as code to view, manipulate, and analyze our data.\r\nThere are packages that come built-in with R. These have names like {base}, {utils}, and {stats}.\r\nSince R is open-source, users are able to create their own packages so that other R users can use them. These packages are available in places like the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN for short) and GitHub.\r\nLucky for us, packages are easily retrieved from the command line. If you haven’t already, run the following code from your console to download the packages that we’ll be needing for this semester:\r\n\r\n\r\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\r\ninstall.packages(\"skimr\")\r\ninstall.packages(\"epiR\")\r\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"potato-nathan/epiAssist\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLoad libraries\r\nTo enable R to use a package’s functions in our current project environment, we need to load the packages using library()\r\nIn a fresh code chunk, call in the {tidyverse} and {skimr} packages using the following code:\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(skimr)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that when we install packages, we need to specify their names using quotes, but when we load them into R using library(), R recognizes them as package objects automatically. You can surround them with quotes and it will load all the same.\r\nTask 4: Load data\r\nYou will use the dataset Lab_0_kenya.rds for this lab. You’ve hopefully already saved this lab’s dataset to the folder Lab 0 > data. You will use the function readRDS() to import the data file from your computer’s folder.\r\nSince our project is located within the folder called “Lab 0”, our computer will automatically look within that folder for the data.\r\nAll we need to do is specify that it’s in the folder called “data”.\r\nUse the following code to load your data into R and give it the name kenya.\r\n\r\n\r\nkenya <- readRDS('data/Lab_0_kenya.rds')\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<- is called the Assignment Operator. We can use it to assign names to objects in our coding environment:\r\nWe can use our assignment operator for characters, numbers, logical operators, etc.:\r\n\r\n\r\nfruit <- \"oranges\"\r\n\r\nnumber <- 99\r\n\r\nlogical <- FALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that the above values are stored in our environment, we can use them in various other functions or operations:\r\n\r\n\r\npaste(fruit, \"are orange\", sep = \" \")\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"oranges are orange\"\r\n\r\nnumber + 1\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 100\r\n\r\nisTRUE(logical)\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nWe’ve done the same thing with our dataset, giving it the name kenya. Use the function head() to view the first six rows in the dataset:\r\n\r\n\r\nhead(kenya)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTask 5: Explore the dataframe\r\nFamiliarize yourself with the data by using the commands ncol(), nrow(), class(), and names().\r\nAre there any string/character variables?\r\nAre there any variable or value labels?\r\nDo any variables have notes?\r\nSimilar to the function head(), we can feed our kenya dataframe to various functions that tell us other useful information about it.\r\nUse ncol() to print the number of columns in our dataframe\r\nUse nrow() to print the number of rows\r\nUse class() to view each variable’s “type”\r\nUse names() to view each variable’s name.\r\nTask 6: Create variable mage\r\nCreate a variable mage for mother’s age (as an integer) at the time of each child’s birth (note – some of these mothers have had multiple children) using the mutate() function. This is calculated from variables b3 (month code of child’s birth) and v011 (month code of mother’s birth). The difference between the values of these variables is months, so divide by 12 to get years. See the data dictionary for a more detailed description of month codes and how to use them. Use the as.integer() function within your mutate() function to truncate the calculated value to an integer.\r\nREMINDER: For your mutate function to work, you have to merge the changes into your dataset. As an example, use this before the mutate function: kenya <- kenya %>%\r\nTask 7: Frequency distributions of mage\r\nSuppose you want to break down mage into three categories. First, look at the frequency distribution (one-way frequency table) for mage to see where you might draw lines for your categories using the table() command.\r\nAre there any missing values for age? If so, how many?\r\nWhich range of ages appear the most frequently in mage?\r\nTask 8: Create variable magec\r\nUsing mage, generate a new variable with three categories: <18, 18-39, and ≥ 40, naming the new variable “magec” (mother’s age categorical). Set the values for magec to be 0,1,2, where 0 corresponds to the youngest age group (<18). Recommended steps:\r\nFirst, don’t forget to use the assignment operator to save your changes to the kenya dataframe.\r\nThen, use mutate() to create a new variable, magec,\r\nwithin your mutate() command, use case_when() to create a series of conditional statements that assigns number 0, 1, and 2 to each category\r\non a new line of code, use factor() to assign labels to each level of your new variable\r\nVariable Label: “Age in years categorized”\r\nValues:\r\n0: <18\r\n1: 18-39\r\n2: ≥ 40\r\nTask 9: Cross-tab of mage and magec\r\nLook at a cross-tabulation (two-way table) of mage and magec to ensure that magec was created correctly. Be sure missing values were handled properly (all observations that have a missing value for mage should be assigned the R missing value “NA” for magec.). Type “?table” for help with how to create a 2x2 table. Note: the order of the variables in the command controls which one is in the rows and which is in the columns of the table. Experiment to make your table readable.\r\nTask 10: Save new dataset\r\nSave the new dataset in the same directory using a different file name with the form shown in the instructions on page 1 using the saveRDS() command.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
