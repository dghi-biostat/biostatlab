Fill it in with your answers to the following lab tasks. Once you’re finished, rename it as firsInitial_YourLastName_Lab0.Rmd, and submit it using the Sakai dropbox.\r\nLab_0_kenya.rds - data file available on Sakai\r\nLab 0 Goals:\r\nBy the end of this lab, you will have demonstrated a basic familiarity with the R coding environment and R Markdown files. You will be able to:\r\nStart a new project and import data\r\nUnderstand useful R terminology\r\nUse summary statistics to describe the Kenya dataset\r\nCreate a categorical variable using a continuous one\r\nGenerate histograms and boxplots using ggplot2\r\nCreate a simple cross-tabulation of two variables\r\nTask 1: Establish a workflow\r\nIn R, we organize our work by projects. It is best practice to keep no more than one project in any single folder on your computer. First, we should establish the file folders from which we’ll be working.\r\nCreate folders to store your work\r\nIf you haven’t already, now would be a good time to:\r\nCreate a new folder on your computer called “705 Lab”.\r\nWithin that folder, create a folder for this lab, called “Lab 0”.\r\nFinally, within that folder, create a folder for your data, called “data”\r\nSave the dataset titled Lab_0_kenya.rds (from Sakai) into the folder called “data”\r\nPlease make this a habit. We will expect you to do this for every lab, as it will keep your work organized and will keep you happy.\r\nCreate a New Project in RStudio\r\nNow open RStudio and take a deep breath. Don’t panic. This will all be very familiar in a few short months.\r\nInitiate a new project by going to File and clicking New Project.\r\nTODO: INSERT SCREENSHOT\r\nThen select Existing Directory and hit Browse. Navigate to the folder titled Lab 0. Open it, then hit Open.\r\nTask 2: Familiarize yourself with R Markdown\r\nNow, you will open a special kind of document known as “R Markdown”. This is a text editor (like Word or Google Docs), but with a twist. You can run code within the document. This makes data analysis an interactive, iterative (and therefore fun?) process that usually looks like this:\r\nWrite some code intended to transform your data\r\nRun the code\r\nObserve how your dataset behaved\r\n(Optional) Take a few notes\r\nTweak code\r\nRepeat\r\nFor each lab, we will provide you with a skeleton Markdown file on Sakai. If you haven’t already, download that file (“lab0_705_fall2021.Rmd”) and save it to your folder called “Lab 0”.\r\nNow open the file in RStudio. You can just double-click on it from the file folder. It will appear, but might feel a little pinched. Luckily, RStudio allows Markdowns to pop-out.\r\nClick the white square at the top of the file that I’ve circled in the photo below to do just that:\r\nPop-outTask 3: Load packages and data\r\nInstalling packages\r\nPackages are collections of functions. As we’ll see shortly, we use functions as code to view, manipulate, and analyze our data.\r\nThere are packages that come built-in with R. These have names like {base}, {utils}, and {stats}.\r\nSince R is open-source, users are able to create their own packages so that other R users can use them. These packages are available in places like the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN for short) and GitHub.\r\nLucky for us, packages are easily retrieved from the command line. If you haven’t already, run the following code from your console to download the packages that we’ll be needing for this semester:\r\n\r\n\r\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\r\ninstall.packages(\"skimr\")\r\ninstall.packages(\"epiR\")\r\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"potato-nathan/epiAssist\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLoad libraries\r\nTo enable R to use a package’s functions in our current project environment, we need to load the packages using the library() function.\r\nIn a fresh code chunk, call in the {tidyverse} and {skimr} packages using the following code:\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(skimr)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that when we install packages, we need to specify their names using quotes, but when we load them into R using library(), R recognizes them as package objects automatically, and so don’t need quotes. You can surround them with quotes and it will load all the same.\r\nTask 4: Load data\r\nYou will use the dataset Lab_0_kenya.rds for this lab. You’ve hopefully already saved this lab’s dataset to the folder Lab 0 > data. You will use the function readRDS() to import the data file from your computer’s folder.\r\nSince our project is located within the folder called “Lab 0”, our computer will automatically look within that folder for the data.\r\nAll we need to do is specify that it’s in the folder called “data”.\r\nUse the following code to load your data into R and give it the name kenya.\r\n\r\n\r\nkenya <- readRDS('data/Lab_0_kenya.rds')\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe <- is called the Assignment Operator. We can use it to assign names to objects in our coding environment:\r\nWe can use our assignment operator for characters, numbers, logical operators, etc.:\r\n\r\n\r\nfruit <- c(\"oranges\", \"papayas\", \"apricots\")\r\n\r\nnumber <- 99\r\n\r\nlogical <- FALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that the above values are stored in our environment, we can use them in other functions or operations:\r\n\r\n\r\npaste(fruit, \"are orange\", sep = \" \")\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"oranges are orange\"  \"papayas are orange\"  \"apricots are orange\"\r\n\r\nnumber + 1\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 100\r\n\r\nisTRUE(logical)\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nWe’ve done the same thing with our dataset, giving it the name kenya. Use the function head() to view the first six rows in the dataset:\r\n\r\n\r\nhead(kenya)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTask 5: Explore the dataframe\r\nFamiliarize yourself with the data by using the commands ncol(), nrow(), class(), names() and skim().\r\nAre there any string/character variables?\r\nAre there any variable or value labels?\r\nDo any variables have notes?\r\nSimilar to the function head(), we can feed our kenya data frame to various functions that tell us other useful information about it.\r\nUse ncol() to print the number of columns in our data frame\r\nUse nrow() to print the number of rows\r\nUse class() to view each variable’s “type”\r\nUse names() to view each variable’s name.\r\nUse skim() to print summary statistics for each variable in the data frame\r\nTask 6: Create variable mage\r\nUsing a pipe and the mutate() function, create a new variable, mage for mother’s age (as an integer) at the time of each child’s birth (note – some of these mothers have had multiple children). This is calculated from variables b3 (month code of child’s birth) and v011 (month code of mother’s birth). The difference between the values of these variables is months, so divide by 12 to get years. See the data dictionary for a more detailed description of month codes and how to use them. Use the as.integer() function within your mutate() operation to truncate the calculated values for mage to integers.\r\nThe mutate() function works with the following syntax.\r\n\r\n\r\n# don't forget to write over your old dataframe with the new \"mutated\" one\r\ndata <- data %>%\r\n  mutate(newVariableName = (Variable1 - Variable2))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTask 7: Frequency distributions of mage\r\nSuppose you want to break down mage into three categories. First, look at the frequency distribution (one-way frequency table) for mage to see where you might draw lines for your categories using the table() command.\r\ntable() works by identifying unique values within a variable, and then counts them.\r\nIt works on character variables, categorical (factor) variables, and even numbers.\r\nWe can tell R to look at specific variables inside our dataframe with the $ sign. The syntax looks like this: dataframeName$variableName\r\nWe must also provide the argument useNA = 'always' to our table() function in order to include NA values in the tabulation.\r\nUse table() to look at mage, then consider the following questions:\r\nAre there any missing values for age? If so, how many?\r\nWhich range of ages appear the most frequently in mage?\r\nTask 8: Create variable magec\r\nUsing mage, generate a new variable with three categories: <18, 18-39, and ≥ 40, naming the new variable magec (__m__other’s age __c__ategorical). Set the values for magec to be 0,1,2, where 0 corresponds to the youngest age group (<18). Recommended steps:\r\nFirst, don’t forget to use the assignment operator to save your changes to the kenya data frame.\r\nThen, use a pipe (%>%) and then mutate() to create a new variable, magec,\r\nwithin your mutate() command, use case_when() to create a series of conditional statements that assign numbers 0, 1, and 2 to each category\r\non a new line of code, use factor() to assign labels to each level of your new variable\r\nValues:\r\n0: <18\r\n1: 18-39\r\n2: ≥ 40\r\nConvert a variable to a factor with the following syntax:\r\n\r\n\r\ndataframe$variableYouWantToFactor <- factor(dataframe$variableYouWantToFactor,\r\n                                            labels = c(\"Label for 0\", \"Label for 1\", \"Label for 2\"))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTask 9: Cross-tab of mage and magec\r\nLook at a cross-tabulation (two-way table) of mage and magec to ensure that magec was created correctly. Be sure missing values were handled properly (all observations that have a missing value for mage should be assigned the R missing value “NA” for magec). Try the two separate methods for cross-tabulation, as we will be using both for separate purposes later in the semester:\r\nMethod 1:\r\nType “?table” in the console for help with how to create a 2x2 table. Note: the order of the variables in the command controls which one is in the rows and which is in the columns. Experiment to make your table readable.\r\n\r\n\r\n# example code:\r\n\r\ntable(data$x, data$y, useNA = 'always')\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethod 2:\r\nWe can also use tidyverse functions to accomplish a two-way tabulation of our variables of interest. These functions will become increasingly relevant and useful, and are a big reason why R is such a popular platform for data science. We will use a pipe (%>%), group_by(), another pipe, and count() to get the same output given by table().\r\n\r\n\r\n# example code:\r\n\r\n# notice that we don't want to assign this operation to a name\r\n# we just want to view the output, hence the lack of \"data <- \"\r\ndata %>%\r\n  group_by(x, y) %>%\r\n  count()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA translation of the above code to written instructions would go as follows, where bolded words represent the grammatical equivalent of our pipe, %>%:\r\n“Take dataset, data, and then group_by by variable x, then within those groups, group by variable y, and then count the values in each of our groups.”\r\nHere’s a link to learning more about pipes. Or just take a look at this tweet:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTask 10: Save new dataset\r\nUsing function saveRDS(), save the new dataset in the same directory as our original data, using the following format: “firstInitial_YourLastName_lab0.rds”\r\nsaveRDS() takes two primary arguments:\r\nThe dataframe object you want to save\r\nThe location in which you’d like it saved as a .rds file\r\nDon’t forget the following:\r\nThe file locations should be in quotes, so that R knows to read it as a character string\r\nYour file should be saved in your local Lab 0 folder, data/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Calculate percentages only for the non-missing values. Round percentages to 1 decimal place.\r\nWe would like you to use a pipe (%>%) with group_by() and summarize() to generate summary statistics.\r\ngroup_by() works by grouping rows by categorical variables. It then allows a function like summarize() to calculate summary statistics on those sub-groups, including percentages and frequency counts.\r\nAs an example, we can use the mtcars dataset available within RStudio:\r\n\r\n\r\nhead(mtcars)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmpg\r\ncyl\r\ndisp\r\nhp\r\ndrat\r\nwt\r\nqsec\r\nvs\r\nam\r\ngear\r\ncarb\r\nMazda RX4\r\n21.0\r\n6\r\n160\r\n110\r\n3.90\r\n2.620\r\n16.46\r\n0\r\n1\r\n4\r\n4\r\nMazda RX4 Wag\r\n21.0\r\n6\r\n160\r\n110\r\n3.90\r\n2.875\r\n17.02\r\n0\r\n1\r\n4\r\n4\r\nDatsun 710\r\n22.8\r\n4\r\n108\r\n93\r\n3.85\r\n2.320\r\n18.61\r\n1\r\n1\r\n4\r\n1\r\nHornet 4 Drive\r\n21.4\r\n6\r\n258\r\n110\r\n3.08\r\n3.215\r\n19.44\r\n1\r\n0\r\n3\r\n1\r\nHornet Sportabout\r\n18.7\r\n8\r\n360\r\n175\r\n3.15\r\n3.440\r\n17.02\r\n0\r\n0\r\n3\r\n2\r\nValiant\r\n18.1\r\n6\r\n225\r\n105\r\n2.76\r\n3.460\r\n20.22\r\n1\r\n0\r\n3\r\n1\r\n\r\nSay we want to know the frequency counts of cars with 4, 6, and 8 cylinders (variable: cyl) based on whether or not a car has an automatic or manual transmission (variable am, 0 = automatic, 1 = manual).\r\nWe can use group_by() to create subgroups according to am and cyl. Using group_by() by itself doesn’t alter the appearance of our data frame, but our observations are now implicitly grouped according to transmission type and number of cylinders.\r\n\r\n\r\nmtcars %>%\r\n  group_by(am, cyl)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmpg\r\ncyl\r\ndisp\r\nhp\r\ndrat\r\nwt\r\nqsec\r\nvs\r\nam\r\ngear\r\ncarb\r\n21.0\r\n6\r\n160\r\n110\r\n3.90\r\n2.620\r\n16.46\r\n0\r\n1\r\n4\r\n4\r\n21.0\r\n6\r\n160\r\n110\r\n3.90\r\n2.875\r\n17.02\r\n0\r\n1\r\n4\r\n4\r\n22.8\r\n4\r\n108\r\n93\r\n3.85\r\n2.320\r\n18.61\r\n1\r\n1\r\n4\r\n1\r\n21.4\r\n6\r\n258\r\n110\r\n3.08\r\n3.215\r\n19.44\r\n1\r\n0\r\n3\r\n1\r\n18.7\r\n8\r\n360\r\n175\r\n3.15\r\n3.440\r\n17.02\r\n0\r\n0\r\n3\r\n2\r\n18.1\r\n6\r\n225\r\n105\r\n2.76\r\n3.460\r\n20.22\r\n1\r\n0\r\n3\r\n1\r\n\r\nWe might use summarize() to operate on these sub-groups. summarize() works with the following syntax:\r\n\r\n\r\nmtcars %>%\r\n  group_by(am, cyl) %>%\r\n  summarize(columnName = Function(variable), \r\n            anotherColumnName = anotherFunction(variable),\r\n            etc., etc....)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepending on whether our variable is categorical or continuous, we can use summary statistic functions like n() (for raw counts), mean(), sd(), median(), IQR(), min(), and max() within our summarize() function. Except for n(), which doesn’t take any arguments, the rest of these functions take a variable name.\r\nWe can start by using n() for sub-group frequency counts.\r\n\r\n\r\nmtcars %>%\r\n  group_by(am, cyl) %>%\r\n  summarize(Counts = n())\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nam\r\ncyl\r\nCounts\r\n0\r\n4\r\n3\r\n0\r\n6\r\n4\r\n0\r\n8\r\n12\r\n1\r\n4\r\n8\r\n1\r\n6\r\n3\r\n1\r\n8\r\n2\r\n\r\nThen we can use mutate() to operate on our summary table as if it were its own data frame.\r\nWithin mutate(), we create a new variable with NewVariable =, and equate it to the following operation: Counts / sum(Counts, na.rm = TRUE) (sub-group counts divided by the sum of sub-group counts).\r\n__**Note__: na.rm = TRUE instructs the function to remove NA values from the sum of values in our sub-group.\r\n\r\n\r\nmtcars %>%\r\n  group_by(am, cyl) %>%\r\n  summarize(Counts = n()) %>%\r\n  mutate(Proportions = Counts / sum(Counts, na.rm = TRUE))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nam\r\ncyl\r\nCounts\r\nProportions\r\n0\r\n4\r\n3\r\n0.1578947\r\n0\r\n6\r\n4\r\n0.2105263\r\n0\r\n8\r\n12\r\n0.6315789\r\n1\r\n4\r\n8\r\n0.6153846\r\n1\r\n6\r\n3\r\n0.2307692\r\n1\r\n8\r\n2\r\n0.1538462\r\n\r\nAlso notice that we’re able to do this within one continuous pipe.\r\nTask 6: Data dictionary (Table 2)\r\nTable 2 is the data dictionary for the Kenya dataset, with columns added to annotate the variables and provide summary statistics.

You will need the {tidyverse} package as well.\r\nTask 2: Code derived variables\r\nConstruct the following derived variables. For each, examine the component variables for missing values (e.g. ‘missing’, ‘unknown’) and be sure to set derived variable values appropriately (e.g., check to make sure that your NA values have not been mistakenly added to another category). Variables should be of the correct type. Convert all categorical variables to factors, labeling them appropriately.\r\nTask 2a: size\r\nsize: Categorical variable describing size of child at birth (subjectively described by mother). Note that greater values indicate smaller size: [1=very large, 2=larger than average, 3=average, 4=smaller than average, 5=very small]. Based on variable m18.\r\nTask 2b: belowavg\r\nbelowavg: Dichotomous variable indicating if the child’s size was below average [0= average, larger than average or very large, 1=smaller than average, very small]\r\nTask 2c: pnc\r\npnc: Dichotomous categorical variable for any prenatal care [0 = the referent category; no prenatal care; 1 = the index category; received prenatal care]. Based on variable m2n.\r\nTask 2d: rural\r\nrural: Dichotomous indicator of rural residence [0=urban, 1=rural]. Based on variable v025.\r\nTask 2e: education\r\neducation: Categorical educational level obtained by mother [create values for 0=did not attend school, 1=primary school only, 2=post-primary education]. Based on variable s109.\r\nTask 2f: death\r\ndeath: Dichotomous categorical variable for death within the first 5 years of life [0 = child alive at 5th birthday (the referent category); 1 = child died before 5th birthday (the index category)]. Based on the variables b5 (death indicator) and b7.\r\nNote: When creating this new variable, we want our conditional statement to account for two factors: Whether a child died, and if they did, whether or not that death occurred before their 5th birthday.\r\nTask 2g: time\r\ntime: Continuous variable for the age at death OR age at interview for children still alive. Based on b7 (age at death for children dead at interview); for children alive at time of interview, calculate their age using v008 (date of interview) and b3 (date of birth). Note that times are given in months.\r\nTask 3: Close the cohort\r\nCreate the equivalent of a closed cohort for the analysis of 5-year childhood mortality from this dataset . In a closed cohort, everyone must be at risk of the outcome at entry into the cohort, and all members of the cohort must remain at risk until they experience the outcome or complete the entire risk period for the outcome.\r\nA closed cohort allows for estimation of absolute (unconditional) risks and associated effect measures. For this study, the risk period for child mortality begins at birth and ends when a child dies, or when 60 months of life have been completed. I recommend completing the steps below in order to generate what we want. There are other orders in which to do this, but sometimes you will get incorrect results. If you’re adventurous, I recommend trying other ways to code this; you’ll learn a lot from that exercise.\r\nNOTE: Complete task 3 before completing the remaining tasks.\r\nTask 3a: Exclude irrelevant observations\r\nExclude those observations from the dataset where the child was alive (death=0) and follow-up time (time) was less than 60 months (think about which Boolean operator you’ll need to exclude those children). You should end up with 16,828 subjects in the dataset. In this step, you should also use an assignment operator (<-) to assign this closed cohort to a different object name. That way, you will be able to work with this dataset separately in the coming steps.\r\nTask 3b:\r\nAlso, if a child was still alive by their 5th birthday, we need to recode their time to 60 (we are censoring these observations). These children were alive at 5 years of age and so should not be counted as deaths in our analysis.\r\nTask 3c: Recode time to (time + 1)\r\nFinally, recode the time variable to indicate the month of life during which death or interview occurred (add 1 month to the current value). The range on time should now be 1 month – 61 months.\r\nTask 3d: Save new dataset\r\nSave this new dataset containing 16828 subjects (make sure to give it a new name).\r\nTask 4: Frequency histograms\r\nGenerate frequency histograms of time, overall and separately for levels of death. Put meaningful axis labels and a title on each figure.\r\nTODO: Help with histograms in ggplot2\r\nTask 5: Boxplots of time\r\nGenerate boxplots of time, overall and separately for levels of death. Put meaningful axis labels and a title on each figure.\r\nTODO: Help with boxplots in ggplot2\r\nTask 6: Frequency counts and percentages (Table 1)\r\nFill in Table 1 with the frequency counts and percentages for the levels of the new categorical variables you have generated. Calculate percentages only for the non-missing values. Round percentages to 1 decimal place.\r\nRefer to the previous lab for help on frequency counts and percentages.\r\nVariables:\r\nSize at birth (size)\r\nSize at birth categorical (belowavg)\r\nPrenatal care (pnc)\r\nResidence type (rural)\r\nMother’s education (education)\r\nDeath by 5 years (death)\r\nTask 7: Update data dictionary (Table 2)\r\nUpdate your data dictionary for the Kenya dataset, adding the newly created variables.\r\nTask 8: Short Answer\r\nExamine the range and proportion of missing for each of the variables 7 you have created in this lab. Are there characteristics of any of these variables that are concerning (e.g., missing, suspicious or impossible values)? In contemplating analysis of these data, what do you think should be done with anomalous information?

This pattern will help in grading this assignment.\r\nThis should be obvious, but do not round intermediate values. Only round final answers for submission.\r\nIf rounding for a given table is not specified or not clear, ask your lab instructor for clarification.\r\nUnless specified within the task instructions, use 3 decimal places for risks and differences and 2 decimal places for rates and ratios.\r\nTo aid in our grading of these assignments, the last figure kept should be rounded UP when the first figure dropped is >= 5. For example, in rounding to 2 decimal places, 0.235 should be reported as 0.24 and 0.245 should be reported as 0.25. Note that this method will introduce a small bias to higher numbers, but another method, “rounding-to-even”, confuses many users.\r\nGrading:\r\n(TODO - change this grading guideline?) RMarkdown files will be graded on an all or nothing. If your markdown file runs from start to finish with no errors, you will receive full credit. If it hits an error message, you will receive NO credit (for the purposes of grading, if any “chunk” of code in your file contains special options, we will ask you to resubmit a file omitting them).\r\nR MARKDOWN FILE: Your markdown file MUST have the following components:\r\nan informative YAML header (see guide to Lab 0[TODO])\r\na set of commands calling in all relevant packages\r\na line of code calling in the analysis dataset\r\neach task’s code performed under the appropriate subheading\r\nif a task requires plotting with ggplot2, a line of code saving said plot using ggsave()\r\n\r\nTABLES: a certain number of points are allocated for each item. Errors include but are not limited to: incorrect values, omissions, and inappropriate rounding. For ease of grading, please do not alter the dimensions of any table. If you are confused on which values go where, please reach out to us for clarification.\r\nSHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS: will generally be graded as follows: 20% of allocated points for some sign of sentience; 40% of allocated points for getting at least part of the answer; 60% of allocated points for a pretty good answer; 80% of allocated points for an excellent, solid answer; 100% of allocated points for an out-of-the-ballpark answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
